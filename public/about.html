<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sean Griscti.</p>
  
<p>I am a semi-retired Senior Software Engineering Manager. After working in the 
IT industry for over 30 year, I am now looking forward to pursuing some of my
personal projects and ambitions.</p>

<p>Creating my own website is something I have wanted to do for many years, but
  have never really found the time.</p>

<p>Music, and specifically playing the guitar, has always been a passion. With much more
  time on my hands, I am excited about the opportunity to spend more time practicing
  and playing the guitar.
</p>

<p>Then there is cooking. I love to cook and would classify myself as competent.
  I can cook most things, but would now like to focus on developing my 
  culinary skills to the next level.</p>
